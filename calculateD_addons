%RUN final_landscapes_2016.m

%MODIFIED: used distances only with >30 pairs of points, and distances which were
%less than half the maximum distance.

%THIS VERSION IS MUCH WORSE AT ESTIMATING D...

%code takes a landscape and calculates the distances between all points and
%the semivariance at all distances.  log(semivariance)~log(distance) is
%plotted as a semivariogram.  The slope of that semivariogram is an
%estimate of fractal dimension D.  Equation and methods are from Burroughs
%1983.

entries = (dim^2)-1; %entries minus the first one
