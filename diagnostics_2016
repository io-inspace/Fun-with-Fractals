%what kind of data do you want from each landscape?

%Standard Deviation:
SD = zeros(1,iterations); %puts the SD from each iteration into a vector
%D:
fractalD = zeros(1,iterations); %puts the D from each iteration into a vector
%lacunarity:
L = zeros(1,iterations); %puts the lacunarity from each iteration into a vector

%THE BIG LOOP = 1 complete landscape per iteration:

%PARAMETERS

%landscape type:

D = 2.1; %set the fractal dimension D; can range from >2 to 3.  For D = 2 see final_landscapes_2016_D2.m
H = 3 - D; %H, the scaling factor, ranges between >0 and 1.
sigma = .5; %set the standard deviation SD; Palmer maxes out at 2.5
normalization = 1; %do you want to normalize at the end?
%OK...normalizing messes up the gradient, and if you don't you still get
%the right D and SD.
figuresYN = 1; %do you want to get figures at the end?


%landscape size:

dimension = 65; %choose array size (2^maxlevel+1).  
%NOTE: anything larger than 65 won't run if you try to calculate D.
dim = dimension;
k = dim - 1; %k is the number of diagonals in the matrix

%how many steps are needed to fill it all in?
maxlevel = log(dimension-1)/log(2); 

%landscape border:
border = (2^maxlevel); %borders will allow the midpoint averages to calculate
inset = (2^maxlevel)/2; %insetting builds the matrix within the borders, these will be removed at the end
rows = dim + border; %matrix + border = inset on all four sides
cols = dim + border; %matrix + border = inset on all four sides

%the landscape:
landscape = zeros(rows,cols);

%CORNERS:
%corners (1,1) and (last,last) are the intermediate values, while corners
%(1,last) and (last,1) are the extreme values: [1 4 2 3]

delta = sigma; %this is the first delta: the original sigma
corners = sort(delta*randn(1,4));%this is to get a pretty gradient look
