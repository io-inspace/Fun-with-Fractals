%perfectly balanced landscapes (g2) and completely random landscapes (g3)

%using Palmer to build some landscapes with one abiotic gradient.

%components:
%spatially explicit landscape 
%modifiable parameters: a, b, n

%for D = 2 use g(x,y) = ax + by where a and b are pulled from a normal
%distribution between -1 and 1:

min = -.5;
max = .5;
x = (min:.001:max);
u = mean(x);
v = var(x);
a = u + v*randn(1,1);
b = u + v*randn(1,1);
%make sure your a and b values are between -1 and 1!  Figure out how to
%write something to throw up a warning if not.  For now to keep everything
%standard use fixed a & b:

a = .5;
b = .2;

%now that we've set a & b apply them to a matrix g(x,y).
%to figure out spatial autocorrelation according to Saupe 1988 you need a
%landscape 2^n+1 cells to a side:
n = 3; %modify this to increase or decrease the size of the landscape
dim = 2^n + 1;
rows = dim; %number of row positions
cols = dim; %number of column positions
g2 = zeros(rows,cols); %g2 is a matrix with D = 2

%then write the for loop:
for pos1 = 1:rows;
    for pos2 = 1:cols;
    g2(pos1,pos2) = a*(pos1) + b*(pos2);
    end
end

%for D = 3 it's just a 20x20 position matrix filled in with numbers pulled
%from a Gaussian distribution:
g3 = randn(dim); %g3 is a matrix with D = 3.
%need a way to "set seed" but it doesn't seem to want to work.
